-------------------------------------------
"demo.sh": 
	You can run this code to get the white-balanced image of input.
        Changing '--input' to change different input images.
        The result are save in the folder 'result_images'.
        To use this code, do: 'sh demo.sh'
-------------------------------------------
"imgs":
        Some images are in the folder "example_images".
        These images are from Rendered Cube dataset.
        You can use this as the input image of demo.
